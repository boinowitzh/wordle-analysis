# Wordle-Analysis
There has been a big hype around the NY Times' word guessing game wordle recently.

In this repo I investigated how wordle works from a Data Scientific point of view by 
- some Explorative Data Analysis (EDA), researching if the length of the words (5 letters) 
- a simulation, where a computer solves wordles
- interpreting and visualizing the simulation results
- showing a live-simulation in a dashboard app with the wordle design
